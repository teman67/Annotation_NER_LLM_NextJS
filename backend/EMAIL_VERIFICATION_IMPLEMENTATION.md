Perfect! I've successfully implemented email verification for your authentication system. Here's what has been added:

## Backend Changes:

1. **Database Schema Updates**:

   - Added `email_verified`, `email_verification_token`, and `email_verification_expires` columns to the users table
   - Created migration scripts to add these columns to existing database

2. **New Authentication Endpoints**:

   - `/api/auth/verify-email` - Verifies email with token
   - `/api/auth/resend-verification` - Resends verification email

3. **Updated Registration Flow**:

   - Registration now creates unverified users with verification tokens
   - Sends verification email (currently prints to console for development)
   - Returns success message instead of immediate login

4. **Updated Login Flow**:
   - Login now checks if email is verified before allowing access
   - Returns specific error message if email verification is required

## Frontend Changes:

1. **Enhanced AuthContext**:

   - Added `verifyEmail()` and `resendVerification()` functions
   - Updated registration to handle verification flow

2. **Updated EmailVerificationPage**:
   - Handles email verification with URL tokens
   - Shows different states: verifying, success, error
   - Includes resend verification functionality
   - Auto-redirects to dashboard on successful verification

## Next Steps:

1. **Add the email verification columns to your Supabase database**:

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE public.users
   ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS email_verified BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
   ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS email_verification_token VARCHAR(255),
   ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS email_verification_expires TIMESTAMPTZ;
   ```

2. **Test the flow**:

   - Register a new account
   - Check server console for verification URL
   - Visit the verification URL to verify email
   - Try logging in

3. **Production Email Setup** (optional):
   - Configure SMTP settings in the `send_verification_email()` function
   - Use services like SendGrid, AWS SES, or similar

The email verification system is now fully functional! Users must verify their email before they can log in to the application.
